## Abstract
### Background and objectives:
Long-term trends in health risk factor prevalence, and in inequalities, are often summarised using age-standardised point prevalence to allow for age distribution changes over time and between groups. Policies to effectively promote health require the decomposition of social change into its age-period-cohort components. As a first step, we provide a descriptive age-cohort analysis to identify patterns of generational change in key behavioural risk factors between and within post-war cohorts of working age in England.
### Data:
Cross-sectional Health Survey for England data for participants aged 25-60 years was pooled between 1994-2019 (n=153,172) to construct five decennial cohorts (1940s, 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, 1980s). Socioeconomic status was classified by neighbourhood deprivation quintiles using the Index of Multiple Deprivation. Five behavioural risk factors were analysed: cigarette smoking (current- and heavy-smoking); alcohol consumption (frequency and heavy drinking); obesity; meeting recommended levels of physical activity and fruit and vegetables consumption. 
### Methods:
Sex-specific analyses were conducted. Log-binomial regression models quantified the magnitude and direction of change in (i) prevalence ratios (PRs) between cohorts adjusting for age and deprivation, and (ii) deprivation-specific PRs within- and between-cohorts to examine changes in absolute and relative inequalities between generations.
### Results:

### Conclusion:
